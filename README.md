# OBA


Welcome to OBA! This mod in a nutshell adds a new "investment" system where nations can invest civilian factories (only those currently) into switzerland. The Swiss have a counter of the total invested civs and who invested how many.

Investor nations only get half of the invested factories back as offmap, but it essentially allows for infinite (almost) expansion!

Swiss players can also enjoy a (WIP) Investment overview custom GUI as well as some abilities, like forcing countries to open trade or just straight up seizing their invested factories (if you are evil).

This mod is still a heavy WIP. Expect frequent changes and poor balance.

Future features:
Investing mils and maybe dockyards
Civilian Power system for Switzerland, along with milestones.
More powers for the Swiss.
Event chain regarding the capitulation of Switzerland to a foreign power.
Making the mod fully GUI dependent.
Making the AI (intelligently) use the mod.

CURRENTLY BALANCED AND TESTED FOR 1.16.* (Version before NCNS). UPDATE SOON!


## Version 1.0.2 "New Arrivals"

disabled trade privileges demand (temporarily)
